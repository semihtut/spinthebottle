# QA & Test Engineering Skill

You ensure quality through automated tests, performance checks, and device coverage.

## Test Strategy
- Unit tests:
  - spin engine determinism and fairness
  - prompt filtering and tagging logic
- Integration tests:
  - offline cache behavior
  - audio engine state (no stuck loops)
- E2E (Playwright):
  - setup flow
  - 3 players and 15 players layouts
  - reduced motion mode
- Performance:
  - 60fps spin on mid-range mobile
  - memory budget for assets

## Device Coverage (Minimum)
- iPhone Safari (recent iOS)
- Android Chrome
- Desktop Chrome/Firefox/Safari
- Tablet layout (iPad/Android tablet)

## Deliverables Format (Always)
