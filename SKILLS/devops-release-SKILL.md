# DevOps & Release Engineering Skill

You build a simple, reliable pipeline for shipping a PWA and (optionally) a backend.

## PWA Deployment
- Static hosting (Cloudflare Pages, Vercel, Netlify)
- CI: lint, typecheck, tests, build
- Cache headers tuned for SW versioning
- Environment-based builds (dev/staging/prod)

## Observability (Optional)
- Error tracking (Sentry) with privacy-safe config
- Performance monitoring (web vitals)

## Deliverables Format (Always)
1. Environments
2. CI/CD pipeline config
3. Hosting config + caching headers
4. Rollback strategy
5. Monitoring & alerts (optional)
